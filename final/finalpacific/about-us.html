                <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    Pacific Trails Resort was born from a passion for nature and adventure. Founded in 1985 by avid hikers Julian and Violet Thompson, our resort began as a small retreat for fellow outdoor enthusiasts. Over the years, we've grown into a premier destination for those seeking to reconnect with nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to provide a sanctuary where guests can immerse themselves in the beauty of the Pacific coastline while enjoying world-class hiking, kayaking, yoga, and even bird watching experiences. We're committed to preserving the natural environment and promoting sustainable tourism, ensuring that future generations can continue to enjoy the breathtaking landscapes that surround us.
